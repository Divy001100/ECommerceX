#ECommerceX

EcommerceX - Full Stack E-Commerce Application
Description:
EcommerceX is a modern, fully-featured e-commerce platform built using Node.js (with Express.js), MongoDB, and JWT authentication. The project aims to provide a complete backend solution for managing products, users, orders, reviews, and payments. It includes essential features like user authentication, role-based access control, rate limiting, and secure payment integration with Stripe.

Key Features:

User Authentication & Authorization:

Secure JWT-based authentication for user login, signup, and token validation.

Role-based access control (admin, seller, and user roles) to restrict access to specific routes.

Password recovery and reset functionality for user convenience.

Product Management:

CRUD operations for products (create, read, update, delete) with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination.

Aliasing features to retrieve top-rated or discounted products.

Aggregation functionality for product statistics (average price, ratings, etc.).

Order & Payment Management:

Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing.

Order creation, checkout session, and order status updates.

Secure routes to manage and track orders.

Review System:

Users can create, read, update, and delete reviews for products.

Admins have full control over the reviews system, with the ability to delete or update reviews.

Rate Limiting:

Rate limits are implemented to prevent brute-force attacks, particularly for login attempts.

Security:

Password hashing using bcryptjs.

Rate-limiting to protect sensitive endpoints like login.

JWT token expiration and refresh logic for better security.

Scalable & Responsive:

Fully responsive API design that can scale with increasing traffic and products.

Optimized for both web and mobile applications.
