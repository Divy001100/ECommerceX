EcommerceX API
EcommerceX is a highly-scalable, full-featured e-commerce backend API built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It handles critical e-commerce functionality including user authentication, product management, order processing, and payment integration with Stripe. The application follows MVC architecture, ensures security best practices, and utilizes advanced features like XSS protection, Rate Limiting, SQL injection prevention, and more.

Key Features
Authentication & Authorization
JWT-based authentication for secure, stateless login and registration.

Role-based access control (RBAC) with distinct user roles: Admin, Seller, User.

Secure password management using bcryptjs for hashing.

Rate-limiting implemented on authentication routes to prevent brute-force attacks.

Product Management
Product CRUD operations with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination.

Aliasing for dynamically fetching the top-rated products, discounted items, and more.

Aggregation pipeline to calculate product statistics such as average price and rating.

File uploads handled using Multer, with image optimization via Sharp.

Support for multiple categories, sizes, colors, brands, and more.

Order & Payment Integration
Secure payment processing via Stripe for checkout and order management.

Order tracking with customizable statuses like pending, paid, shipped, and delivered.

Integration with webhooks for real-time payment verification and order updates.

Review & Rating System
Users can create, update, and delete reviews for products.

Admins can manage all reviews, ensuring the integrity of the platform.

Star ratings integrated into product listings for better customer decision-making.

Admin Panel
The EcommerceX API includes a comprehensive Admin Panel that gives administrators full control over various critical aspects of the platform. Admins can manage user accounts through the /api/v1/users route, where they can view, update, or delete user profiles, ensuring proper access control and monitoring user activity. The Admin Panel also provides full access to product management via the /api/v1/products route, enabling admins to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on products. This includes adding new products, updating existing product details, removing obsolete products, and managing product attributes like price, description, and images. Additionally, the admin panel allows for review management through the /api/v1/reviews route, where admins can view, approve, update, or delete reviews to ensure the integrity of the platform. This separation of user and product control ensures a seamless experience for admins, while maintaining data security and enforcing platform standards. The panel also enables advanced filtering and aliasing of products, making it easy to access specific groups of products, such as top-rated or best-selling items. The Admin Panel is an essential tool for maintaining the overall integrity, functionality, and security of the platform.


Security Features
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection: Sanitizes user input to prevent malicious scripts from being executed in the browser.

HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) Protection: Prevents the manipulation of URL parameters to ensure data integrity and avoid injection attacks.

SQL Injection Prevention: Removes characters like dots (.) and dollar signs ($) from incoming requests to prevent malicious queries.

Rate Limiting: Prevents brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests that can be made to specific endpoints, particularly login and password reset endpoints.

Secure password management using bcryptjs to hash user passwords.

JWT token expiration and refresh logic to maintain secure sessions.

Advanced Features

Advanced Filtering: Filter products based on price, rating, category, and more.

Aggregation Pipeline: Performs advanced data processing and analysis like calculating average ratings, prices, and sales statistics.

Aliasing: Dynamically generate queries to fetch top-rated, cheapest, or best-selling products.

Technologies and Architecture
1. MVC Architecture
EcommerceX is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

Model: Represents the data structure (e.g., products, orders, users).

View: APIs exposed to the frontend (e.g., a React or Vue.js app) that interact with the backend.

Controller: Manages business logic and handles incoming requests for specific endpoints (e.g., adding products, updating orders).

2. Database Design
MongoDB with Mongoose provides a NoSQL database for flexible data storage.


Text indexing: For efficient search queries in product descriptions and names.

3. API Design and Security
RESTful API: Allows users to interact with resources (products, orders, reviews) using standard HTTP methods.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Ensures the API is accessible from specific trusted domains (if enabled).

Input validation and sanitization: Protects the system from malicious data, using libraries like express-validator and mongoose santize for sanitizing inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

SQL injection prevention: We sanitize incoming requests to remove dots (.) and dollar signs ($), preventing malicious characters from reaching the database.

4. Deployment and Scalability
The application is built to scale, and can be deployed on Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS.

Dockerized deployment for seamless integration across different environments.

Supports horizontal scaling with the addition of multiple instances to handle traffic surges.
